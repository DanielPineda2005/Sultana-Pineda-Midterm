                <ul>
                  <li><b>Loneliness:</b> Being invisible might lead to feelings of isolation, as you would be hidden from others and unable to interact freely</li>
                  <li><b>Ethical Dilemmas:</b> The power of invisibility could tempt you to invade people's privacy or commit unethical acts, raising questions about morality and responsibility</li>
                  <li><b>Physical Presence:</b> IEven while invisible, you would still occupy physical space, meaning you could accidentally bump into objects or people, revealing your presence.</li>
                  <li><b>Limited Visibility:</b> Navigating while invisible might be challenging, as you would need to ensure you don't accidentally walk into things or get hurt.</li>
