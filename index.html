                <ul>
                  <li><b>Privacy and Secrecy:</b> Invisibility allows you to go unnoticed, making it easier to avoid unwanted attention and gather information discreetly.</li>
                  <li><b>Stealth and Safety:</b> You could move around without being detected, making it easier to navigate dangerous situations or avoid conflicts.</li>
                  <li><b>Investigative Abilities:</b> Invisibility could be useful for solving mysteries, uncovering secrets, or conducting surveillance without being seen.</li>
                  <li><b>Playful Pranks: </b> You could have a lot of fun playing harmless pranks on friends and family, adding an element of surprise and laughter to everyday life.</li>
                </ul>

              <img src="images/invisible.gif" alt="invade people's privacy ">
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Loneliness:</b> Being invisible might lead to feelings of isolation, as you would be hidden from others and unable to interact freely</li>
                  <li><b>Ethical Dilemmas:</b> The power of invisibility could tempt you to invade people's privacy or commit unethical acts, raising questions about morality and responsibility</li>
                  <li><b>Physical Presence:</b> IEven while invisible, you would still occupy physical space, meaning you could accidentally bump into objects or people, revealing your presence.</li>
                  <li><b>Limited Visibility:</b> Navigating while invisible might be challenging, as you would need to ensure you don't accidentally walk into things or get hurt.</li>

          <h3>Reasons to Choose Flight:</h3>

        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <img src="images/clark-kent.webp" alt="The ability to fly" width="400">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Cool Factor:</b> Flying just looks plain cool, Superman looks cool flying and I wanna do that as well.</li>
            <li><b>Transportation:</b> I never have to take the bus ever again, I can just kinda go wherever I want at any time, since I can freaking fly.</li>
            <li><b>Sight-Seeing:</b> If I wanna take a t from the world, I can fly to the top of a big mountain and drink in the view.</li>
            <li><b>Feel a closer connection to birds: </b> I think birds are hella cute, they are the descendants of dinosaurs and that's dope. I wanna have a closer connection with them, we can bond witht the fact that we both fly.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <img src="images/sad.webp" alt="sad superman" width="400">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Attracts unwanted attention:</b> Being able to fly would ultimately attract a lot of attention and would probably freak people out.</li>
            <li><b>Difficulty:</b> Realistically a human being able to fly would be extremely difficult and would require a lot of training to be able to do half-decently good.</li>
            <li><b>Wearing proper eye protection:</b> While flying at high speeds you should be wearing goggles of some kind to protect your eyes, and that would make you look like a nerd.</li>
            <li><b>Accidents:</b> There's a high probability to suffer an accident while flying like superman, especially when I don't have his super strength and durability.</li>
